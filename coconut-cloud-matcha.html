        <ol>
            <li>
                Use a milk frother (a blender or hand mixer will work here too!) to whip up the double cream, milk, and sifted matcha until a pourable but thick consistency is reached.

                Add ice and coconut water to a glass, pour matcha cold foam on top. Enjoy!
